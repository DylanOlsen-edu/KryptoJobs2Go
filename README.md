# KryptoJobs2Go
### Background

You work at a startup that is building a new and disruptive platform called KryptoJobs2Go. KryptoJobs2Go is an application that its customers can use to find fintech professionals from among a list of candidates, hire them, and pay them. As KryptoJobs2Goâ€™s lead developer, you have been tasked with integrating the Ethereum blockchain network into the application in order to enable your customers to instantly pay the fintech professionals whom they hire with cryptocurrency.

In this Challenge, you will complete the code that enables your customers to send cryptocurrency payments to fintech professionals. To develop the code and test it out, you will assume the perspective of a KryptoJobs2Go customer who is using the application to find a fintech professional and pay them for their work.

### What You're Creating

Specifically, you will assume the perspective of a KryptoJobs2Go customer in order to do the following:

* Generate a new Ethereum account instance by using the mnemonic seed phrase provided by Ganache.

* Fetch and display the account balance associated with your Ethereum account address.

* Calculate the total value of an Ethereum transaction, including the gas estimate, that pays a KryptoJobs2Go candidate for their work.

* Digitally sign a transaction that pays a KryptoJobs2Go candidate, and send this transaction to the Ganache blockchain.

* Review the transaction hash code associated with the validated blockchain transaction.

### Instructions

The steps for this challenge are broken out into the following sections:

* Import Ethereum Transaction Functions into the KryptoJobs2Go Application
* Sign and Execute a Payment Transaction
* Inspect the Transaction on Ganache
